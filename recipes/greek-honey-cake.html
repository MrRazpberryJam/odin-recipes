    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>My extra moist Greek honey cake is light, sweet, and has a lot of honey flavor. Orange zest and juice give it just the balance it needs to be a real favorite. It's so easy to make that you don't even need a mixer! You make the batter and pop it in the oven. A simple orange syrup makes an already moist cake even moister. Plus, this is a great alternative to cakes with frosting and perfect to take to a dinner party!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>3/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine honey, 1 cup sugar, and water in a saucepan; bring to a simmer and cook 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice; bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool while you prepare the cake.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch square baking pan.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, orange zest, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat remaining 3/4 cup sugar and butter together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Beat in flour mixture, alternating with milk, beating just until incorporated; stir in walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove cake from oven and poke holes over the surface with a toothpick. Slowly ladle the cooled honey syrup over cake. For best results, set cake aside for 4 to 6 hours to cool and absorb the syrup before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
