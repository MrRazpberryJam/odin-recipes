    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>My extra moist Greek honey cake is light, sweet, and has a lot of honey flavor. Orange zest and juice give it just the balance it needs to be a real favorite. It's so easy to make that you don't even need a mixer! You make the batter and pop it in the oven. A simple orange syrup makes an already moist cake even moister. Plus, this is a great alternative to cakes with frosting and perfect to take to a dinner party!</p>
